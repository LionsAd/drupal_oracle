HOW TO INSTALL ORACLE SUPPORT

cd <path to drupal dir>/includes/database/
tar xzvf <oracle-7.x-*.tar.gz>

TRY

grant connect,resource to drupal identified by drupal;

or 
if yo want to use the db_prefix

grant dba, create any trigger, drop any table, SELECT ANY table, SELECT ANY sequence, create user to drupal identified by drupal;
grant connect, resource to drupal with admin option;
(TODO: those privilege are actually relaxed and should be better defined in the future)
