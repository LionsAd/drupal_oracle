HOW TO INSTALL ORACLE SUPPORT

cd <path to drupal dir>/includes/database/
tar xzvf <oracle-7.x-*.tar.gz>
cd oracle/module
mv oracle <path to drupal dir>/sites/all/modules

GIVE THOSE GRANTS AS A SYSDBA USER

sqlplus / as sysdba

grant connect,resource to drupal identified by drupal;
grant execute on dbms_crypto to drupal;

# to use performance views
grant select on v_$sql_plan to drupal;
grant select on v_$sqlarea to drupal;

or 
if yo want to use the db_prefix

grant dba, create any trigger, drop any table, SELECT ANY table, SELECT ANY sequence, create user to drupal identified by drupal;
grant connect, resource to drupal with admin option;
(TODO: those privilege are actually relaxed and should be better defined in the future)

TNSNAMES: thanks to siromega it is possible to use the tnsnames.ora or any tns valid string like
this sample http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-oci.php#64756, by specifying USETNS
as the hostname at installation time, and using the tns string in the "database name" field.
This may be particularly usefull if you need to connect a RAC instance.. for example.

http://<host>:<port>/drupal/install.php

Once you installed your site, got to http://<host>:<port>/drupal/admin/modules
and enable the Oracle module, then go to http://<host>:<port>/admin/config/development/oracle/blob and click schedule

then create linguistic indexes:
sqlplus drupal/drupal
SQL> exec create_linguistic_indexes;

ENJOY
