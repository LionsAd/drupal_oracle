HOW TO INSTALL ORACLE SUPPORT

cd <path to drupal dir>/includes/database/
tar xzvf <oracle-7.x-*.tar.gz>

TRY

grant connect,resource to drupal identified by drupal;
grant execute on dbms_crypto to drupal identified by drupal;

or 
if yo want to use the db_prefix

grant dba, create any trigger, drop any table, SELECT ANY table, SELECT ANY sequence, create user to drupal identified by drupal;
grant connect, resource to drupal with admin option;
(TODO: those privilege are actually relaxed and should be better defined in the future)

TNSNAMES: thanks to siromega it is possible to use the tnsnames.ora or any tns valid string like
this sample http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-oci.php#64756, by specifying USETNS
as the hostname at installation time, and using the tns string in the "database name" field.
This may be particularly usefull if you need to connect a RAC instance.. for example.

http://<host>:<port>/drupal/install.php

ENJOY
